# RealBench: Real-world Benchmark for Generative AI

## Mission
RealBench addresses the critical gap in AI evaluation by testing models on practical, real-world tasks that humans actually use AI for, emphasizing consistency, practical utility, and robust handling of edge cases.

## Problem Statement
Current AI benchmarks fail to capture real-world usage patterns. Models can solve Math Olympiad problems but fail at basic high school math ([source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/high-school-maths-trumps-olympiad-gold-medalist-ai-models-google-deepmind-ceo-answers-why/articleshow/123286889.cms?from=mdr)). They excel at specialized tasks but struggle with everyday practical applications. RealBench bridges this gap.
